# Activities


Learning about Machine Learning: I'm learning about LSTM networks, RNNs, Behavioral Cloning, and Stable Baselines. This week, I am hoping to utilize the VPT Dataset and train my network.


# Issues


Actions: Throughout my implementation of PPO and A2C, I have faced issues with my actions. Specifically, for my discrete actions, my network outputs action probabilities that are consistently one for one discrete action. Additionally, my agent exhibits a tendency to look down or up.

# Plans

Reading and learning about LTSMs, RNNs, Behavioural Cloning, Stable Baselines, etc.
